                    <p class="col-sm-10 pull-right" id="indent">   Innovation; the common theme that can be found throughout history. Innovating is what many people, including me, strive to do in order to create changes and new ideas that may affect the world. I hope to have a career in the field of Computer Engineering. I am currently taking the class Computer Science Engineering (CSE) where we learn the basic languages and foundations for coding. I look forward to taking more courses relating to Computer Engineering that will extend my knowledge and help me to become a better coder. </p>
                    <p  class="col-sm-10 pull-right" id="indent"> My calm, cooperative personality is a major asset to working with others and communicating with each other in order to accomplish as many tasks as possible. I consider myself to be a team player in doing my part of projects and completing it on time. However, I am also ambitious when I am working individually which helps me accomplish things that I initially would have thought to be too difficult. </p>
                    <p class="col-sm-10 pull-right" id="indent">  I am currently a part of the Dublin High School PATCH club, which helps give comfort to children in need by setting up donation drives for stuffed animals. From my experience, I have learned that it is very rewarding to give and help others instead of always doing things for your own self interest. This helps motivates me to volunteer and contribute to the community, which is a key characteristic when I'm trying to improve communities by creating new things with code.</p>
                    <p class="col-sm-10 pull-right" id="indent">  Throughout my academic career, I have worked well with others and individually. My dreams to help make an impact through coding has motivated me have an effort to learn how to code and will continue to do so. Feel free to explore my portfolio and take a look at my achievements! </p>
